# Power Query Artifactory Utils

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A toolkit of custom Power Query (M) functions designed to simplify data extraction from the JFrog Artifactory REST API.

This repository contains a set of helper functions that allow you to easily connect to your Artifactory instance and pull metadata about repositories, artifacts, versions, and more directly into your data models in **Power BI**, **Excel**, and **Dataflows**.

## Key Features

* **Simplified API Access:** No need to manually build `Web.Contents` calls. These functions handle the specifics of the Artifactory API endpoints.
* **Data Ready for Analysis:** JSON responses are parsed into clean tables, ready for use in your reports.
* **Parameterized & Reusable:** Built with best practices to be easily configured and reused across multiple projects.
* ...*(You can add more specific features as you develop them)*

## Requirements

Before using these functions, you need two things:

1.  **A Power Query Environment:**
    * Power BI Desktop
    * Excel for Windows/Mac (with Power Query support)
    * Power Platform Dataflows

2.  **An `ArtifactoryHost` Parameter:**
    You **must** configure a text parameter in your Power Query environment that holds the base URL of your Artifactory instance.

    * **Name:** `ArtifactoryHost`
    * **Type:** `Text`
    * **Suggested Value:** `https://your-company.jfrog.io`

## Installation & Usage

To use a function from this repository:

1.  **Create a New Blank Query:** In the Power Query Editor, right-click in the queries pane and select `New Query` > `Blank Query`.

2.  **Copy the Code:** Open the `.pq` file for the function you want to use (e.g., `fn-GetVersions.pq`). Copy the entire M code.

3.  **Paste into the Advanced Editor:** In your new blank query, click on `Advanced Editor` and paste the code, replacing any existing text.

4.  **Rename the Query:** Rename the query to match the function's name (e.g., `fnGetVersions`). This makes it easy to find and invoke.

5.  **Invoke the Function:** You can now use the function in other queries or by creating a new blank query and calling it with the required parameters.

    ```m
    let
        // Example of how to call a function from this toolkit
        Source = fnGetVersions("com.mycompany.group", "my-artifact-id")
    in
        Source
    ```
